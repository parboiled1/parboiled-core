parboiled-core
==============

Parboiled1; core mechanics, without Scala support


This is a brand new fork - the purpose is to continue Java development. For now the goals are the following:

* Modularized packages
* Remove Scala support
* Gradlew support
* Publish

Going forwards, maybe we will:

* Add more rules
* Fix bugs!
* Write more tests.

If you are looking for a Scala version, perhaps you will be more interested in Parboiled2.
